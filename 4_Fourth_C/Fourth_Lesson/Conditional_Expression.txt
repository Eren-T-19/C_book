    The conditional operator consists of two symbols (? and :), which must be used together in the following way:

                    /*                            expr1 ? expr2 : expr3                                  */



    The conditional expression expr1 ? expr2 : expr3 should be read "if expr1 then expr2 else expr3."The expression
    is evaluated in stages: expr1 is evaluated first; if its value isn't zero, then expr2 is evaluated, and its value
    is the value of the entire conditional expression.If the value of expr1 is zero, then the value of expr3 is the value
    of the conditional.
        The following example illustrates the conditional operator:

    
    int i,j,k;

    i = 1;
    j = 2;
    k = i > j ? i : j;     /* k is now 3 */
    k = (i >= 0 ? i : 0) + j; /* k is now 3 */
